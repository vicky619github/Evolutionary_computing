Regarding Assignment 1,
All 12 of the algorithms in the paper have been worked out, and the majority have also been put into code.

Regarding Assignment 2,
I have implemented White Box Neural Networks and utilized Ant Colony, Particle Swarm, and Grey Wolf Optimization algorithms for optimizing the weights.
